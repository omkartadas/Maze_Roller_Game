# Maze Roller Game

A simple 3D maze game for Android where players control a sphere using accelerometer input to navigate through a maze, avoiding obstacles and reaching the endpoint within a time limit. The game features a scoring system, UI states (Start, Pause, Win, Loss), and a one-life setup for a more engaging experience.

## Features
- **Accelerometer-based Controls**: Move the sphere by tilting the device.
- **Obstacles**: Avoid 2-3 obstacles that penalize your score when collided with.
- **Time-based Scoring**: The remaining time is used to calculate the final score, and collision penalties deduct from it.
- **Interactive UI**: Start, Pause, Win, and Loss screens provide seamless game interaction.
- **Single Life**: You only have one life to complete the maze.

## How to Play
1. **Tilt your device** to move the sphere through the maze.
2. **Avoid obstacles** placed along the path that will penalize your score.
3. Reach the **end point** of the maze before the time runs out to win the game.
4. The score is calculated based on the time remaining and penalties incurred from obstacles.
